"""`RemotePolicy`: what a benchmark drives a served policy with.

    with RemotePolicy(address, authkey, timeout_s=60.0, log_file=server_log) as policy:
        policy.hello()        # {"protocol": 2, "action_type": ..., "observe_every": N, ...}
        policy.set_demonstration(prompt_arrays, info)
        policy.reset(seed)
        action = policy.act(observation)["action"]  # (A,) or a chunk (H, A)

When the policy's `observe_every` is N > 0, `observation` is the stack of observations recorded
every N actions since the last `act` (`zerowam_protocol.observe`), not the current one alone.

It needs numpy and the standard library only. A benchmark imports it; the competitor's side runs
`python -m zerowam_protocol.serve`.

**Every way the policy can fail raises `PolicyUnavailable`**: an error reply, a call that does not
finish within `timeout_s`, a server that hangs up or was never there, a key it refuses, a reply
that is malformed. When `log_file` names the server's log, the exception's message ends with its
tail; otherwise with the tail the server sent in its error reply, if any. A benchmark catches that
one exception and decides what it costs the unit.

**Timeouts are hard.** Connecting (retried while nothing listens yet) and authenticating share
one `timeout_s`, and each call gets its own, covering both sending the request and receiving the
whole reply. When one runs out the socket is shut down, which unblocks whatever was waiting and
tells the server its client has gone; the server exits.

After an error reply to `reset`, `prompt` or `act` the connection stays usable - the server keeps
serving. After an error reply to `hello` the policy could not be built and the server has ended
the session, so, as after any other failure, the connection is closed and every later call raises
`PolicyUnavailable` at once. `close` is the exception: it is best effort and raises nothing, so
leaving a `with` block never replaces the outcome the benchmark already has. A value that cannot
be sent at all, such as an object array, is the caller's mistake: `WireError`, before anything is
sent, and the connection is untouched. One `RemotePolicy` serves one thread at a time.
