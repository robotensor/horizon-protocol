"""The message format between a benchmark and a served policy: named arrays and JSON fields.

Ported from `icilval.model.wire` (ICIL-LiberoGen-bench, branch `milestone-two-fields`).

**Why its own format.** A benchmark's own transport carries that benchmark's types, and a policy
that spoke it would be written for one benchmark. This format carries named arrays and JSON fields
and nothing else: the benchmark and the policy agree on the names (`frames_head`, `qpos`,
`actions`, ...) between themselves, and nothing here reads them.

**What it deliberately cannot do.** It never pickles. `Connection.send` and `Connection.recv`
pickle, and unpickling runs code chosen by whoever wrote the bytes - on one side of this socket is
a competitor's code - so only `send_bytes` and `recv_bytes` are used. Arrays are bool, integer or
float, little-endian; an object array, or any other dtype, is refused before it is sent and when a
header announces it.

**A message** is one JSON header frame,

    {"protocol": 1, "op": "act", "fields": {...}, "arrays": [{"name", "dtype", "shape"}, ...]}

followed by one raw little-endian frame per array, in the order the header lists them. The header
is validated in full before any array frame is read, and each frame is read with the size its
description implies as the limit, so a hostile header cannot size an allocation it does not pay
for.

**Ops.** A client sends `hello` (fields: `client`), `reset` (fields: `seed`), `prompt` (arrays:
the demonstration; fields: `info`), `act` (arrays: the observation) and `close`. The server answers
each with `ok` (the reply to `hello` carries `protocol`, `action_type` and `policy`), `action`
(arrays, `action` among them) or `error` (fields: `type`, `message`, `log_tail`).

**Addresses** are a Unix socket path or `host:port`, both authenticated with a shared key of at
least `MIN_AUTHKEY_BYTES` by `multiprocessing.connection`.
